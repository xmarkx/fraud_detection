    Credit card fraud is a serious issue that affects both financial institutions and credit card users. 
    According to a [2022 study by the **Association of Certified Fraud Examiners**](https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2022/), organizations lose an estimated
    5% of their annual revenues to fraud, with the financial services industry being the hardest hit. 
    In addition, fraudulent transactions can lead to financial losses to individuals.

    To combat credit card fraud, financial institutions need to have effective fraud detection systems in place.
    One approach is to use machine learning algorithms to automatically detect fraudulent transactions based on
    patterns and anomalies in the data. In this project, we built a credit card fraud detection model using the 
    Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from [**Kaggle**]((https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)).

st.write(
    """
    Detecting fraudulent transactions is critical for financial institutions to protect their customers and minimize
    financial losses. However, it's important to strike a balance between accuracy and false positive rates. 
    While it's essential to catch as many fraudulent transactions as possible, flagging too many legitimate 
    transactions as fraudulent can lead to customer dissatisfaction and lost revenue. Therefore, building an accurate
    fraud detection model that minimizes false positives is a significant challenge for financial institutions.
    
    In this presentation, we will walk through the process of building a credit card fraud detection model using 
    the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. We will cover data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model 
    selection and training, and evaluation. Finally, we will discuss how this model can be used by the Anti-Money 
    Laundering (AML) department.
